[Live example](http://rdash.github.io/) of the original.

## Usage
### Requirements
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) (with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/))
* [Bower](http://bower.io)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)?

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/evegeris/groundtruth_webapp.git`
2. Install the NodeJS dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Install the Bower dependencies: `bower install`.
4. Run the gulp build task: `gulp build`.
5. Run the gulp default task: `gulp`. This will build any changes made automatically, and also run a development server via a gulp plugin (gulp-connect) on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

### Development
Continue developing the dashboard further by editing the `src` directory. With the `gulp` command, any file changes made will automatically be compiled into the specific location within the `dist` directory.

#### Modules & Packages
TO add additional modules/packages not included with rdash-angular, add them to `bower.json` and then update `index.html`, to include them in the minified distribution output.
